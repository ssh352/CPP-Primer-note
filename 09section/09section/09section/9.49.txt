The most important factor is phylogeny. Each spider family has its own characteristic arrangement of spinnerets (the organs used to spin the webs), and they decide what type of web can be built. And this shape is adapted to one specific type of habitat. Here's a small, general guide (exceptions abound, as usual):

Mygalomorphs (e.g., trapdoor spiders): most can only construct simple lines of silk, which can act as detectors. They live in burrows, with these sensory silk lines radiating out of them. When the lines are cut, the spider knows that prey is nearby and comes out and ambushes it.

4. Sheet-web builders (e.g., velvet spiders, funnel-web spiders): As the name says, their silk comes out in massive sheets. And the best place to put a sheet is, of course, on some vegetation under a tree, with insects dropping from the tree being a good source of food. Funnel web builders have a bit more control over their webs, being able to connect a circular ("funnel shaped") burrow made out of silk in which the spider lives.

Space-web builders (e.g., linyphiids, theridiids): These webs take up space.Linyphiid ones consist of a bowl made out of tangled threads, and attached to the lower branches of a tree.
